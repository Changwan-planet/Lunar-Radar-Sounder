# Lunar-lava-tubes
We created and used these codes to find the lunar lava tubes in the north of the Rima Galilaei on the Moon. Theses codes are written by Fortran 90 and divided into the two groups: Digital Terrain Modeal (DTM) and Lunar Radar Sounder (LRS). We obtained DTM datasets from the SELENE Data archive (https://darts.isas.jaxa.jp/planet/pdap/selene/index.html.en). Although we can also find LRS dataset in the website, it is not easy to read the released dataset by Fortran 90 because of the its configuration. Therefore, we received the data with the different data configuration from the Dr. Takao Kobayashi. We recommend that you avoid to use high-level language (C or Fortran) to read LRS dataset from the SELENE Data archive.
